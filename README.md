# What's this?

This is a "web-server" following the instructions in the [Rust
Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). Web server in quotes, since
this is nothing serious at all. Just an excuse to play around with
that nice language.

So don't expect this repo to work, and don't expect to understand
what's going on when browsing the commit history. What you see is just
one part of a more complex process of me struggling to understand
Rust. And please don't ask yourself what kind of architecture the
final "web-server" is going to have - remember the quotes! - , nor why
I am focussing on some weird, insignificant parts of a "web-server" to
be.

So there's no installation instructions nor anything else here to see.
Go and learn Rust yourself! Have fun!
