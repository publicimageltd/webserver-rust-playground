# What's this?

This is a "web-server" following the instructions in the [Rust
Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). Web server in quotes, since
this is nothing serious at all. Just an excuse to play around with
that nice language.

So there's no installation instructions nor anything else here to see.
Go and learn Rust yourself! Have fun!
